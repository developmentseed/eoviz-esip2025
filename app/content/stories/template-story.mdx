## Introduction
In the cramped parlor, the air hung heavy, dense with the invisible residue of unspoken words and cautious breaths. CO2, that quiet, faithful companion of all gatherings, slowly rose as the evening wore on, each exhalation leaving a trace like a shadow on the yellowing wallpaper. Where ventilation was scant and the windows stayed shut—whether out of habit or from the chill—the carbon dioxide accumulated, marking the invisible crowding of spirits and bodies alike. And with it, unseen yet as real as dampness, the risk grew: the longer, researchers tell us, that CO2 lingers above the clean air of the garden, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains alive, hovering in droplets, waiting[2][3][4][7]. Thus, in poorly ventilated rooms, the risk doubles and redoubles, the stale air quietly plotting against the fragile continuities of health and habit; only a cracked window, they say, or a burst of cold air, can scatter the invisible threat and restore clarity, though at the cost of a shiver down the spine[5][4][7].
